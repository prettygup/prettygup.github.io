        non-living entity like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of agents are
        Doctor in the healthcare sector, a driver in the mobility sector, or a
        delivery person in the logistics sector. This object can be set at any
        stage of the order lifecycle. This can be set at the discovery stage
        when the BPP wants to provide details on the agent fulfilling the order,
        like in healthcare, where the doctor's name appears during search. This
        object can also used to search for a particular person that the customer
        wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this object gets instantiated
        after the order is confirmed, like in the case of on-demand taxis, where
        the driver is assigned after the user confirms the ride.

        conference link during a teleconsultation.

    Context:
      description: >-
        Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a high-level
        overview to the receiver about the nature of the intended transaction.
        Typically, it is the BAP that sets the transaction context based on the
        consumer's location and action on their UI. But sometimes, during
        unsolicited callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
        is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
        request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP. The context
        object contains four types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information
        about the transaction using fields like `domain`, `country`, and
        `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and receiving
        platform's ID and API URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the
        protocol version that implemented by the sender and,</li><li>Transaction

        transaction_id that represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a

        sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key
        to encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
        passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
        implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during the
        synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the context
        must be sent during all interactions,

        keeping in mind relevance, performance, and opportunity cost. It is

        the BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of payment. However, the
        BAP can send its terms to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
        those terms, it must overwrite the terms and return them to the BAP. If
        overridden, the BAP must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP in
        order to preserve the provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
        case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform offline
        negotiations on the payment terms. Once an agreement is reached, the BAP
        and BPP can resume transactions.

        filter search results. BPPs can use tags to index their catalog to allow
        better search functionality. Tags are sent by the BPP as part of the
        catalog response in the `on_search` callback. Tags are also meant for
        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag, BAPs are meant to render them as
        name-value pairs. This is particularly useful when rendering tabular
        information about a product or service.

    XInput:
      description: >-
        Contains any additional or extended inputs required to confirm an order.
        This is typically a Form Input. Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
        is not enough for the BPP to confirm an order. For example, to confirm a
        flight ticket, the airline requires details of the passengers along with
        information on baggage, identity, in addition to the class of ticket.
        Similarly, a logistics company may require details on the nature of
        shipment in order to confirm the shipping. A recruiting firm may require
        additional details on the applicant in order to confirm a job
        application. For all such purposes, the BPP can choose to send this
        object attached to any object in the catalog that is required to be sent
        while placing the order. This object can typically be sent at an item
        level or at the order level. The item level XInput will override the
        Order level XInput as it indicates a special requirement of information
        for that particular item. Hence the BAP must render a separate form for
        the Item and another form at the Order level before confirmation.
